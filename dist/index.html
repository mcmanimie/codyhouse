						<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the information practices for the website www.thePika3D.com (the “Pika3D Site”), which is owned and operated by Scrib3D LLC. and its affiliates (collectively, "Scrib3D LLC" or “we” or “us”). In this Privacy Policy, we inform our users (“you”) of the following:</p>
<p>1. What information we collect from and about you on the Pika3D Site, how the information is used and with whom it may be shared.<br>
2. What choices are available to you regarding your information.<br>
3. How we safeguard your information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on or through the Pika3D Site.</p>
<h6>Notice to California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights</h6>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “shine the light” law), California residents have a right to request an information-sharing disclosure from a business to which they have provided personal information and which has disclosed their personal information to a third party in the prior calendar year for that third party’s direct marketing use (i.e., not for use in the business’s own marketing).</p>
<p>Other than as specifically described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personal information with a third party for that third party’s direct marketing use, unless we have your consent. To make a request for information-sharing disclosure under this law, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@pika3d.com">info@pika3d.com</a>. Please note that, under this law, we are not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email address.</p>
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that can signal to websites that a user does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website responds to a web browser’s DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about a user. Because the technological standards for DNT signals are not yet uniform, presently responding to DNT signals is optional for websites and many websites do not respond to DNT signals. The Pika3D Site does not currently respond to DNT signals of web browsers.&nbsp; However, should the industry establish uniform technological standards for recognizing and implementing DNT signals, we would be open to following such industry standards.</p>
<h6>What Information We Collect</h6>
<ul>
<li><b>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”):</b> This is information that identifies an individual user personally, such as name, email address, phone number, mailing/shipping address, billing address, and payment account information. We do not collect PII from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us or allow us to receive it from a third-party source. We ask for and collect your PII when you engage in an identification activity on the Pika3D Site, such as creating an account, placing an order, submitting a request or inquiry to us, subscribing to our emailing list, etc. (each, an “Identification Activity”). An Identification Activity also includes linking your account on a third-party social media site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) with your account on the Pika3D Site (if such linkage is supported by our site). For example, we may support single sign-on that allows you to log into your account on the Pika3D Site using your account on a third-party social media site, and if you use such feature we may automatically receive your information (such as your name and profile photo) from your account on that social media site.Whether or not to disclose PII is completely your choice. However, without providing PII you will not be able to engage in or complete an Identification Activity. You must be at least 18 years of age to engage in an Identification Activity on the Pika3D Site.</li>
<li><b>Aggregate and Anonymous Information (“AAI”):</b> This refers to information that does not identify an individual user personally. For example, we use Google Analytics (tools provided by Google) to collect and analyze statistical data about visitors to the Pika3D Site, and the data collected through Google Analytics helps us measure and understand the demographics, usage patterns, interests, trends, etc. about visitors. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends and usage data without identifying individual users.&nbsp; For more information about our use of Google Analytics, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section of this Privacy Policy. Also, from time to time we may aggregate our customers’ PII by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as names) so as to “anonymize” or “de-personalize” the information.</li>
<li><b>User Activity Information (“UAI”):</b> This refers to certain information that we automatically collect when a user visits the Pika3D Site, which includes, for example: (i) information about the device you use to visit our site (such as device type, operating system, browser type, etc.);&nbsp;(ii) your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address and information related to that&nbsp;IP Address&nbsp;(such as domain information, your Internet service provider and general geographic location); and (iii) information about your visit to our site, such as the date, time and duration of your visit, the pages and content you viewed, your search queries, and your other interactions with our site; information in this category may also include what website you came from before visiting our site and what website you navigate to when leaving our site. Similarly, if you use the Pika3D Site on a mobile device, we automatically collect certain information about your device, such as your device IP address, device type and operating system, browser type, and your device location data (based on GPS or WiFi signals, if turned on by you). For more information about how we automatically collect information through the use of&nbsp;cookies and other similar technologies, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section of this Privacy Policy.UAI does not tell us who you are and we do not link or combine UAI with our users’ PII. Accordingly, we treat UAI as AAI under this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h6>What We Do With the Information</h6>
<p>The following describes how we use and share our user information (including PII) collected on the Pika3D Site:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>To provide, operate, manage, maintain and improve the Pika3D Site:</b> This includes using PII to enable, administer and manage our users’ Identification Activities. For example, when you place an order on the Pika3D Site, we and our e-commerce service provider will use your information to process, fulfill and ship your order.</li>
<li><b>To communicate with our users:</b> This includes communicating with you regarding your account or an order you have made on the Pika3D Site, responding to a request or inquiry you have submitted to us, informing you about changes to the Pika3D Site (including changes to this Privacy Policy and/or any of our other terms and policies for the Pika3D Site), and sending you information that may be of interest to you (such as news about the Pika3D Site, new products and services we offer, special offers and promotions, etc.). Please note that when you create an account on the Pika3D Site, your email address and mailing address may automatically be added to our emailing and postal mailing lists.</li>
<li><b>To share with third parties for targeted and interest-based advertising purposes:</b> We use the services and tools provided by third parties including Google, AdRoll and Facebook (collectively “Advertising Partners”), to advertise our Pika3D products on third-party websites and mobile apps, and we may share our user information (including PII) with Advertising Partners so that they can target our Pika3D ads to the relevant audiences. For example, Google may show our ads on YouTube to users based on their prior visits to the Pika3D Site. As another example, we may share our user email lists with Advertising Partners for purposes of matching our users with their users and creating targeted audiences for our Pika3D ads. So, if a user who has joined our emailing list is also a user of Facebook, that user may see our ads when visiting Facebook. These Advertising Partners only use email lists we provide to assist with our advertising campaigns, and do not use such lists for targeting ads for any other advertiser.</li>
<li><b>To share with our promotion partners:</b> From time to time we may partner with third parties to conduct joint marketing or promotions (such as sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, etc.) (“Joint Promotions”). If you participate in such a Joint Promotion, your information (including PII) will be collected by both Scrib3D LLC and our third-party promotion partner who may use your information to contact you directly to market and promote its own products or services.</li>
<li><b>To share with others as directed by users:</b> The Pika3D Site may include social media functionalities that allow you to interact and communicate with other users. If you choose to use such functionalities to share your personal information with other users, your information will be made available to others as directed by you.</li>
<li><b>To share with our service providers:</b> We use third-party service providers (“Service Providers”) to provide services and support for the operation, maintenance and security of the Pika3D Site, and they may need to access our user information (including PII) in order to perform tasks for us. For example, we use third-party e-commerce service and logistics providers, to fulfill and ship purchase orders received on the Pika3D Site, and we also use Shopify, PayPal, Stripe, and other similar third-party electronic payment processing services, to collect and process credit card/debit card payments from customers in connection with pre-orders. We require that our Service Providers limit their use of our users’ PII solely to providing services to Scrib3D LLC and that they safeguard our user information and not make unauthorized use or disclosure of the information.</li>
<li><b>To protect our rights, etc.:</b> We may disclose user information (including PII) if doing so, in our good faith belief, is necessary to: (i) protect the rights, property, safety or security of the Pika3D Site, our users, and/or the public (including enforcement of the terms of this Privacy Policy and/or any of our other terms and policies pertaining to the Pika3D Site); (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iii) comply with law or legal process (including a court order or subpoena); and/or (iv) to cooperate with law enforcement (including investigation of an alleged or suspected crime, fraud or other illegal activity).</li>
<li><b>To complete a merger, sale of business or assets, etc.:</b> If Scrib3D LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of business or assets, our user information (including PII) may be transferred to one or more third parties involved in such transaction and, upon such transfer, the relevant third-party privacy policy or policies may govern further use of the information. In the event of such a change of ownership, we will endeavor to notify our customers of the change as well as any choices our customers may have regarding the change.</li>
<li><b>Use and sharing of AAI:</b> Because of the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of AAI, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use and share AAI.Except as expressly otherwise described above, we do not sell, rent, or transfer our users’ PII to third parties.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h6>
<p>The following describes how we and our Advertising Partners use cookies and similar technologies on and in connection with the Pika3D Site:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are small data files that websites and online services send to and store on your computer or mobile device through your web browser (if you allow). Cookies enable websites and online services to recognize your browser and record certain information about your visits. If a cookie is placed by the website or online service you’re currently using, it is called a “first-party cookie.” If a cookie is placed by a website or online service other than the one you are currently using, then it is called a “third-party cookie.”We use first-party cookies on the Pika3D Site to help us remember who you are, to enhance and personalize your experience, to understand and save your preferences for future visits, to compile information about our users, and to carry out other tasks relating to the operation or improvement of the Pika3D Site. We do not use cookies to access information on your computer or mobile device. Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the ability to accept or reject it, or you can choose to routinely and manually delete cookies stored on your computer or mobile device. Each time you revisit the Pika3D Site, your ability to restrict our use of cookies on that service is subject to your browser settings and limitations at the time. Please note that if you choose to disable or reject cookies from the Pika3D Site, the Pika3D Site or portions thereof may become inaccessible or may not function properly.For more information on how to manage cookies, visit http://www.aboutcookies.org/.NOTE: Flash cookies (also known as “local shared objects” or “LSOs”) cannot&nbsp;be rejected, disabled, turned off, opted out, or deleted in the same way as regular cookies such as HTML cookies.

<li><b>Web beacons:</b> The Pika3D Site may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs,” “pixel tags,” etc.) – which are small bits of code embedded in web pages or in emails – to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited a web page, and to understand usage patterns. We may also include web beacons in emails to help us recognize activities such as when an email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in the email were clicked on, etc.&nbsp; Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, web beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive web beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.</li>

    <p>Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in or of New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes, unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph.

    <p>Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.

    <p><b>(c) Entire Agreement/Severability</b>. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Pika3D regarding the use of the Services. Any failure by Pika3D to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Neither party is an agent or partner of the other party.</p>
    <p><b>(d) Assignment</b>. These Terms, and any associated rights or obligations, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by you without Pika3D’s prior written consent. These Terms may be assigned by Pika3D without restriction. These Terms are binding upon any permitted assignee.</p>
